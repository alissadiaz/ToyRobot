# ToyRobot

Hi!
I've used Visual Studio to write the code. So compilation and tests are running via IDE.
I created a separate project for the unit tests which is in https://github.com/alissadiaz/ToyRobotTest/blob/master/ToyRobotTest/test.cpp and https://github.com/alissadiaz/PositionTests/blob/master/PositionTests/test.cpp

I've attached a separate executable file generated by VS via email. 

Example input/output:
  Enter command: place 1, 2, east
  Enter command: move
  Enter command: report
  2, 2, east
  Enter command: left
  Enter command: left
  Enter command: report
  2, 2, west
  Enter command: right
  Enter command: report
  2, 2, north
  Enter command: place 4, 5, south
  Enter command: report
  4, 5, south
